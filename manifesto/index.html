                    <div class="manifesto-text">
                        <p>
                            VCDesign (Value Continuity Design).<br>
                            It is a design philosophy that deals not with "how to build", but how to protect the value
                            after it is built.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In many projects, "completion" is the goal.<br>
                            Meeting specifications, passing tests, celebrating the release.<br>
                            That is considered success.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But years later, the reality left on the ground is harsh.<br>
                            No one can explain why it is designed this way.<br>
                            It works, but no one wants to touch the inside.<br>
                            The original intent is forgotten, and the system becomes merely "a burden to be maintained."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The system survived.<br>
                            But the value has not continued.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And the troublesome thing is,<br>
                            No one witnessed the moment that value was lost.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It wasn't at completion, nor was it an outage.<br>
                            It happens quietly, little by little,<br>
                            During the time of daily operations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            VCDesign is an attempt to treat<br>
                            That "disconnection of value that no one is watching"<br>
                            As a structure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The structure here does not mean hardening it rigid.<br>
                            It is a mechanism so that even as time passes and people change,<br>
                            The intent of "why we did this" and the responsibility continue to be handed over to the
                            next.

                    <h2>1. What VCDesign Truly Envisioned</h2>

                    <div class="manifesto-text">
                        <p>
                            Even when the structure was complete, we kept asking ourselves.<br>
                            Even if the system is complete, does the value truly continue?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Development has "phases", and software has "versions".<br>
                            These are excellent delimiters for managing progress and recording changes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, as time went on, we began to feel a sense of unease.<br>
                            Those delimiters do not tell us what a person experienced there.<br>
                            Nor does it record how the meaning changed due to that experience.<br>
                            And finally, it cannot explain when, where, and to whom responsibility was transferred.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Time is certainly flowing, but that flow does not remain in the design.<br>
                            So, we questioned the unit of design itself.

                        <strong>What is a Chapter?</strong><br>
                        It is not merely a division of time or function.<br>
                        A unit that includes human experience, changes in meaning, transitions of responsibility, and
                        can contain both an "end" and a "next" simultaneously.<br><br>
                        That was the concept of <strong>Chapter</strong> that we arrived at.<br><br>

                        <h3>Passing Value Across Chapters</h3>
                        <p>
                            When the friction of "making" disappeared with AI, the center of gravity of engineering
                            shifted quietly.<br>
                            From "construction" to <strong>handing over value to the next stage without breaking
                                it</strong> amidst the tremors caused by changes in reality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A judgment made in one chapter becomes a premise in the next, eventually becoming a
                            constraint, and someday a responsibility that must be returned.<br>
                            To continue passing value across chapters without severing that chain.<br>
                            That was the essence of the new engineering.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Meaning of "Operation" Changes</h3>
                        <p>
                            Currently, the world simply calls this act "operation".<br>
                            As maintenance after development is finished.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>However, that will change.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In a world where "making" finishes instantly, <strong>continuing value after making (=
                                operation)</strong> becomes the most creative and difficult job.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            VCDesign is not a blueprint for making everything.<br>
                            It is a <strong>map for judging "in which chapter responsibility should be returned to
                                humans"</strong> in an era where the act called operation becomes the main character.

                <strong>Supplement: For those who need a more logical explanation</strong><br>
                This manifesto is intentionally written to be short and metaphorical.<br>
                If you need an explanation organized from an engineer's perspective on "why talk so much about
                responsibility" or "what happens *after* vibe coding", a detailed version is available below.<br><br>

                        With AI, theoretically "strongest designs" can always be created.<br>
                        The reason we still don't choose them is <strong>because we would end up shouldering
                            responsibilities we shouldn't.</strong>

                    <p class="manifesto-text">
                        Design is not optimization, but the judgment of accepting responsibility and returning
                        responsibilities not accepted.<br>
                        In a world where "being able to make" is no longer a value, we choose the path of
                        <strong>"continuing to choose only designs where we can fulfill responsibility".</strong>

                        If you resonate with the definition on the right—<strong>"Not a builder, but a person who
                            continues value"</strong>—<br>
                        VCDesign is the place for you.
