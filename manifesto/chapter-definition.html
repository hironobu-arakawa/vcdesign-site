                        Software development already has excellent delimiters.<br>
                        "Versions" to manage source code.<br>
                        "Phases" to manage project progress.

                    <p class="muted">
                        These are perfect management units for the "maker".<br>
                        However, when the system starts running and is exposed to the flow of reality, these units
                        become powerless.<br>
                        Because decisive information is missing there.
                    </p>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <strong>Missing Information:</strong><br>
                        "Who bears the weight of that judgment?"

                        Even if the version doesn't change, if the situation on the ground changes, the "meaning" of the
                        system changes.<br>
                        Even if the phase is complete, if the locus of responsibility is vague, operators are forced to
                        continue making the most difficult decision of "doing nothing".
                    </p>

                    <ul class="rules">
                        <li class="rule">Versions delimit code, but not responsibility.</li>

                        That is why we needed a new unit.<br>
                        A vessel to contain both the time of making and the time of continuing, and to pass the baton of
                        responsibility without dropping it.<br>
                        That is the <strong>Chapter</strong>.

                    <p class="muted">
                        A chapter is not a functional grouping in a system.<br>
                        It is the definition of <strong>"a declared period where the design guarantees value under a
                            specific context and responsibility."</strong>
                    </p>

                        Three elements are packaged indivisibly in one chapter.
                    </p>

                    <dl class="definition-list">
                        <dt>1. Context</dt>
                        <dd>
                            Background information on "why this design was chosen" and "what was considered correct at
                            the time".<br>
                            It preserves the "agreement" on how the gap between the textbook "standard" and the "reality
                            of the field" was interpreted and implemented at that time.
                        </dd>

                        <dt>2. Boundary of Responsibility</dt>
                        <dd>
                            A line drawn to define "up to where the system guarantees, and from where humans should
                            judge".<br>
                            The system cannot absorb all tremors of reality (delays, losses, exceptions).<br>
                            A chapter explicitly states the treaty that "humans decide this tremor".
                        </dd>

                        <dd>
                            This is the most important. A chapter always has an "End" defined.<br>
                            Operation has no end, but a chapter has an end.<br>
                            When "premises change" or "a certain period passes", the chapter closes, and responsibility
                            is returned to the next chapter (or human).

                    <p class="muted">
                        The ideal (standard) of system development always assumes a "world that doesn't tremble".<br>
                        <strong>That is not a defect, but a condition for establishment.</strong><br>
                        However, the field is always living in a "trembling world".<br>
                        Time trembles, orders flip, and judgments change on the spot.
                    </p>

                    <p class="muted">
                        A Chapter is a <strong>"structure to pass tremors"</strong> placed between these two worlds.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Cutting the "Weight" of Operation</h3>
                    <p class="muted">
                        In operation fields, "judgment overload" often occurs, exhausting the field.<br>
                        This is because all past judgments (compromises during design, temporary values during projects)
                        continue to flow into operation without being organized.
                    </p>
                    <p class="muted">
                        By introducing chapters, this flow can be cut off.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="rules">
                        <li class="rule">"This judgment is based on the premises of Chapter 1."</li>
                        <li class="rule">"Since premises changed, Chapter 1 ends."</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="muted">
                        This releases operators from "infinite responsibility"<br>
                        and allows them to focus on "judgments within the defined chapter".
