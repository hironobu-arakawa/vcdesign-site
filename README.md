VCDesign Site

This repository hosts the source of vcdesign.org,
a site dedicated to presenting VCDesign as a conceptual framework for thinking about system design.

VCDesign is not a software product, algorithm, or control specification.
It is a perspective for reflecting on how decisions, responsibility, and system boundaries are conceptually positioned in complex socio-technical systems.

What VCDesign Is

VCDesign focuses on how boundaries shape meaning in system design.

In real-world systems, decisions are not isolated technical events.
They exist at the intersection of people, tools, organizations, and time.

VCDesign provides a way to describe and reason about these boundaries,
without prescribing implementation details, execution rules, or operational procedures.

What VCDesign Is Not

VCDesign does not define:

decision-making algorithms

execution rules or control logic

conditional flows, gates, or state machines

operational instructions for automated systems

Any materials in this repository are illustrative and conceptual,
and are not intended to function as executable specifications or system behavior definitions.

Repository Structure

This repository contains:

A minimal top page introducing the VCDesign perspective

Conceptual materials used to explain boundary-oriented thinking

References that preserve original ideas without enforcing interpretation

The structure is designed to separate ideas from implementation,
and to avoid conflating conceptual discussion with system behavior.

Purpose of This Site

The purpose of vcdesign.org is to:

provide a shared vocabulary for discussing boundaries in design

encourage careful consideration of responsibility, meaning, and context

support dialogue across disciplines where technical systems meet human judgment

VCDesign intentionally remains implementation-agnostic.

Disclaimer

This site does not describe a method for executing, automating, or enforcing decisions.
It presents a design perspective only.

Any resemblance to specific system behavior, operational rules, or control logic
is incidental and not prescriptive.
