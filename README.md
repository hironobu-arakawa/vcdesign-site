# VCDesign Site

This repository contains the source of vcdesign.org.

The site is designed as a set of boundaries, not as an explanatory document.

Each section has a distinct responsibility:
- Core defines constraints and assumptions.
- BOA describes construction methods.
- Origins preserves primary source materials without interpretation.

The top page intentionally minimizes information.
Its purpose is to place boundaries and provide orientation,
not to teach or persuade.

Explanations, justifications, and narratives
belong outside this site.
