name:
  short: VCD
  full: VCDesign

tagline:
  en: Design the place where decisions live, so systems survive change
  ja: 判断の「置き場所」を設計し、変化の中で壊れない構造を残す

intent:
  - This file defines the immutable core of VCDesign (VCD)
  - It is designed to be read by humans and LLMs
  - It defines design principles, not implementations
  - It subsumes construction methods (e.g., BOA) without binding to a domain

---

philosophy:

  premise:
    - Meaning is not universal; it is bound to context
    - Systems change; design must assume incompleteness
    - What cannot be designed should not be fixed
    - Decisions always have owners; responsibility must remain explicit
    - Storage is not flow; persistence is a consequence, not a starting point

  anti_goals:
    - Converting design into a checklist of "best practices"
    - Treating a single interpretation as globally correct
    - Freezing operational judgment into systems "because we can"
    - Optimizing local layers while breaking end-to-end survivability
    - Hiding responsibility behind tools, documents, or AI

---

core_rules:
  # These are the five irreversible rules distilled from the "mother articles".
  - id: context_defines_meaning
    statement:
      en: Meaning is not universal; the same words diverge across worlds.
      ja: 同じ言葉でも、属する世界が違えば意味は一致しない。

  - id: outcome_requires_judgment
    statement:
      en: Outcomes do not emerge from data; they emerge only when judgment is possible.
      ja: 成果はデータからは生まれず、判断が成立したときにだけ現れる。

  - id: boundary_limits_carrying_meaning
    statement:
      en: A boundary is where meaning can be defined but can no longer be fully carried.
      ja: 境界とは、意味を最後まで引き受けられなくなる地点である。

  - id: design_for_unavoidable_variation
    statement:
      en: Do not fix what cannot be designed; design only structures that survive variation.
      ja: 設計できないものは固定せず、壊れない構造だけを設計する。

  - id: storage_is_a_result_not_a_start
    statement:
      en: Storage is not a design starting point; it is the consequence of a data flow.
      ja: 保存は設計の起点ではなく、流れの結果である。

design_targets:
  # What VCD primarily designs.
  - decision_placement
  - boundary_declaration
  - evolution_survivability
  - interpretation_isolation
  - responsibility_explicitness

non_targets:
  # What VCD intentionally does not prescribe.
  - product_selection
  - specific_system_topology
  - detailed implementation patterns
  - domain-specific KPIs

relationship_to_boa:
  statement:
    en: BOA is a construction method under VCDesign for separating Fact, Meaning, and Responsibility by boundaries.
    ja: BOAはVCDesignの下にある工法であり、境界で事実・意味・責務を分離するための実装指針である。
  invariants_alignment:
    - Fact is immutable
    - Meaning is contextual and revisable
    - Responsibility remains human-owned
    - Boundaries prevent silent meaning drift and responsibility leakage
    - Promotion to shared artifacts requires explicit Resolution
  reference:
    - repo: BOA
      file: boa_core.yaml

ai_positioning:
  # Keep consistent with BOA: AI generates hypotheses, never owns responsibility.
  role:
    - generate hypotheses
    - suggest interpretations
    - detect inconsistencies
    - enumerate trade-offs
  forbidden:
    - making final decisions
    - owning responsibility
    - overwriting facts
    - silently promoting private context into shared artifacts
  promotion_guard:
    requires:
      - explicit human responsibility owner
      - explicit resolution (purpose-bound, time-bound)
      - auditable rationale

---

evolution:
  allowed_changes:
    - new examples
    - clarifications
    - additional derived patterns (in separate files)
  restricted_changes:
    - the five core_rules
    - responsibility must remain explicit and human-owned
  versioning:
    - breaking changes require new core version

---

scope:
  applicable_to:
    - industrial systems
    - information systems
    - socio-technical systems
    - AI-assisted design and decision environments
  not_applicable_to:
    - fully autonomous decision systems
    - domains requiring zero ambiguity and zero human judgment
