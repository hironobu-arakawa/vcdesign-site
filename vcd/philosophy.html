                    VCD did not start from theory.<br>
                    It started by observing "environments that cannot be recovered later" and separating <strong>what
                        survived from what broke</strong>.

                        VCD does not place "correct theory" first.<br>
                        What it places first is observation.

                        VCD treats this difference not as "coincidence", but as a <strong>difference in

                        What is important here is not "correctness".<br>

                        Why place this as "Philosophy" rather than "Methodology"?<br>
                        Because while methods can change depending on the environment,
                        the patterns of breaking repeat surprisingly often.

                        VCD leaves the "premises for not breaking" in a form that does not depend on the
                        environment.<br>
                        And BOA / RP / IDG are the entry points to implement those premises as concrete boundaries.
