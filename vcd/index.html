        <h1>The philosophy behind VCDesign Core.</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">
          VCD (Value Continuity Design) explains why VCDesign Core exists.  
          It defines the conditions under which value and responsibility survive  
          even when context, meaning, or organizational structure change.

          <h2>Why this document exists</h2>
          <p>
            This page explains <strong>why VCDesign Core exists</strong> —  
            not how to use it.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            If you are looking for tutorials, examples, or usage instructions,  
            this is not the right place.  
            VCD exists to clarify the <strong>thinking boundary</strong> behind the Core.

      <!-- The problem -->
      <section class="card">
        <div class="inner">
          <h2>The problem VCD addresses</h2>
          <p>
            In systems that continue operating after deployment,  
            a recurring problem appears regardless of domain or technology.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            Decisions are made.  
            But later, no one can clearly answer:
          </p>
          <ul class="rules">
            <li class="rule"><strong>who</strong> made the decision</li>
            <li class="rule"><strong>under what assumptions</strong> it was made</li>
            <li class="rule"><strong>where responsibility</strong> begins and ends</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="muted">
            This is not caused by lack of skill.  
            It happens because decisions are not treated as design artifacts.  
            They disappear into documents, meetings, or tacit understanding.

      <!-- Observations -->

          <h2>What was observed</h2>
          <p>
            VCD did not start from theory.  
            It started from observing environments where:
          </p>
          <ul class="rules">
            <li class="rule">decisions could not be rolled back</li>
            <li class="rule">mistakes could not be corrected later</li>
            <li class="rule">responsibility had to remain clear over time</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="muted">
            Some decision structures survived operation.  
            Others did not.
          </p>

        <div class="inner">
          <h2>The core insight</h2>
          <p>
            What survived shared a common trait:
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            <strong>They made decision boundaries explicit.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Not as process rules.  
            Not as organizational policy.  
            But as part of the system’s design itself.

      <!-- What VCD does -->
      <section class="card">
        <div class="inner">
          <h2>What VCD does (and does not do)</h2>
          <p class="muted">
            VCD does not attempt to:
          </p>
          <ul class="rules">
            <li class="rule">define correct decisions</li>
            <li class="rule">automate responsibility</li>
            <li class="rule">optimize outcomes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Instead, it focuses on one thing only:
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            <strong>Designing where decisions are allowed to become final.</strong>

          <h2>Why the Core is machine-readable</h2>
          <p>
            Human discussions are good at exploring possibilities.  
            They are bad at preserving boundaries over time.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            VCDesign Core is machine-readable so that decision boundaries can:
          </p>
          <ul class="rules">
            <li class="rule">remain stable</li>
            <li class="rule">be reviewed consistently</li>
            <li class="rule">be reasoned over by both humans and AI</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is not an implementation detail.  
            It is a design choice.

      <!-- Relationship to AI -->
      <section class="card">
        <div class="inner">
          <h2>Relationship to AI</h2>
          <p>
            AI systems are good at proposing interpretations.  
            They are not suited to owning consequences.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            VCD does not try to make AI “safer” by restricting it.  
            It makes AI safer by:
          </p>
          <p><strong>never allowing it to decide where responsibility begins.</strong></p>

      <!-- What follows -->
      <section class="card">
        <div class="inner">
          <h2>What follows from this philosophy</h2>
          <p class="muted">
            From this philosophy emerge:
          </p>
          <ul class="rules">
            <li class="rule">the separation of Fact, Hypothesis, and Resolution</li>
            <li class="rule">the distinction between Core and Bindings</li>
            <li class="rule">the refusal to treat operational judgment as configuration</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These are not features.  
            They are constraints.

      <!-- Final note -->
      <section class="card">
        <div class="inner">
          <h2>Final note</h2>
          <p>
            If this philosophy feels strict,  
            it is because it was formed in places where looseness did not survive.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            VCDesign Core exists to preserve these constraints  
            even when systems grow, teams change,  
            and decisions are revisited years later.
