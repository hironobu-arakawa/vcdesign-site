                    VCD deals not with "methods," but with the <strong>inevitability of breaking</strong>.<br>
                    Why do value and responsibility tend to disappear when the context (Chapter) changes?

                        When the context (Chapter) changes, the meaning of the same words changes.<br>
                        When meaning changes, the value to be protected becomes ambiguous.<br>
                        Without boundaries, the locus of responsibility disappears, leading to unexplainable results.

                        VCD is needed not to talk about ideals.<br>
                        But because in a world where context (Chapter) changes, the probability of value and
                        responsibility disappearing is high.

                        VCD anticipates that breakage,<br>
                        and provides the prerequisites for deciding "where boundaries are needed".
