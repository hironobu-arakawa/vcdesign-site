        <h1>Separate Fact, Meaning, and Responsibility.</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">
          BOA is one of the four entry points of the VCDesign ecosystem.  
          It is a construction method that separates <strong>Fact</strong>, <strong>Meaning</strong>, and <strong>Responsibility</strong>  
          across boundaries by default-async.  
          BOA can be used standalone.

                In BOA, the inability to produce bounded Meaning

                This deferral represents a structured handoff

              <strong>Do I need VCDesign to use BOA?</strong>

            <li class="rule">
              <strong>Is BOA only for factories?</strong>
